## General 
  ### How long have you been programming?
  I started "programming" back when I was in Middle School, I started with scratch, a GUI block bases system. I then did Python at school. I started Web Dev in 2017, with Adobe    Dreamweaver, but the site was super ugly, so I learned HTML and CSS to make it nicer.
