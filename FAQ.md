## General 
  ### How long have you been programming?
  I started "programming" back when I was in Middle School, I started with scratch, a GUI block bases system. I then did Python at school. 
  
  I started Web Dev in 2017, with Adobe Dreamweaver, but the site was super ugly, From that point I started watching videos by Dark Code (see bellow) and was super insprired.
  
  I wanted to learn HTML and CSS to make it nicer. It all started with a science project I wanted to make a website to act as an information page. 
  
  I only knew a little bit of HTML and setting colours with CSS, so it wasn't great.
  
  ### How do you learn? 
  I tend to use a website called [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) To learn the basics of a language this is how I started out learning HTML, CSS and JS.
  
  Then as with anything you learn by doing, so I watched youtube videos, followed tutorials and then built my own stuff when I felt confident.
  When learning something new I tend to google around for resources, and there is usually a thread on reddit where people suggest resouces such as youtube channels.
  
  Books are also pretty useful as a reference, so some books that I recommend are: "HTML CSS by John Ducket", "Javascript and JQuery by John Ducket" and "Python tricks by Dan Bader" for my python peeps. 
  
  ### What Resources Do you recommend for beginners?
  - For me personally the number one resource is **youtube**, As a student I perfer not to spend money on online courses, so most of these resources will be free.
    - Youtube: there are so many free courses for just about anything on youtube, here are some examples:

## Tools 
  ### What developement tools do you use?
  - I mainly use VSCode to write code, I sometimes use Sublime for quick changes as it a ligher code editor.
    - For quick python code I use the IDE that comes with python.
  - I use Postman to test APIs. Sometimes postwoman because it's easier to use online.
  - Stretchly; I've only recently started using this, but it gives you a pop up, telling you to take a break. 
  - I use figma for UI design
  - I use Github projects to plan things out.
